# Assignment4
Build a Serverless App with Cloud Run that Creates PDF Files

# Background 
Cloud Run is serverless, so it abstracts away all infrastructure management and lets you focus on building your application instead of worrying about overhead. As a Google serverless product, it is able to scale to zero, meaning it won't incur cost when not used. It also lets you use custom binary packages based on containers, which means building consistent isolated artifacts is now feasible.

In this lab you will build a PDF converter web app on Cloud Run that automatically converts files stored in Cloud Storage into PDFs stored in seperated folders.

In this lab, you will learn how to:

Convert a Node JS application to a container.
Build containers with Google Cloud Build.
Create a Cloud Run service that converts files to PDF files in the cloud.
Use event processing with Google Cloud Storage
